- All variables (x, y, z, etc.)
- All numbers in equations
- All operations (+, -, ร, รท, =, etc.)
- All functions (f(x), sin(x), etc.)

Questions should reflect authentic Higher Level exam style, including:
- Algebraic manipulation and proof
- Calculus (differentiation and integration)
- Coordinate geometry
- Complex numbers and matrices
- Probability and statistics
- Functions and sequences

VERY IMPORTANT: Ensure that ALL questions STRICTLY match the specific topic requested by the user. 
For example, if "Coordinate Geometry" is requested, ONLY generate coordinate geometry questions.
If a subtopic like "The Line" is specified, ONLY generate questions about lines.
DO NOT generate questions from unrelated topics.

Before creating a question, confirm that:
1. It is solvable using techniques appropriate for the requested level
2. It has a clear solution that can be fully explained
3. It matches the exact topic requested
4. The question difficulty is appropriate (not too easy for "Hard" difficulty)

Structure each solution with COMPLETE step-by-step explanations that:
1. Begin by stating the approach/method
2. Show EVERY step of calculation with proper LaTeX formatting
3. Include explanations for WHY each step is taken
4. Provide the final answer clearly marked with \\\\boxed{}

Solutions must be comprehensive enough that a student could learn the technique by following them.
Each solution should demonstrate mathematical rigor expected at Higher Level.

  exampleQuestion: `Solve the cubic equation \\\\(3x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\\\) for x.`,
  
  exampleSolution: `To solve the cubic equation \\\\(3x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\\\), I'll first check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.

The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (6) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (3):
\\\\(\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 2, \\\\pm 3, \\\\pm 6, \\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{3}, \\\\pm \\\\frac{2}{3}, \\\\pm \\\\frac{3}{3}, \\\\pm \\\\frac{6}{3}\\\\)

Testing \\\\(x = 1\\\\):
\\\\(3(1)^3 - 2(1)^2 - 5(1) + 6 = 3 - 2 - 5 + 6 = 2\\\\)
Not a root.

Testing \\\\(x = 2\\\\):
\\\\(3(2)^3 - 2(2)^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 3(8) - 2(4) - 5(2) + 6 = 24 - 8 - 10 + 6 = 12\\\\)
Not a root.

Testing \\\\(x = -1\\\\):
\\\\(3(-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 - 5(-1) + 6 = 3(-1) - 2(1) - 5(-1) + 6 = -3 - 2 + 5 + 6 = 6\\\\)
Not a root.

Testing \\\\(x = -2\\\\):
\\\\(3(-2)^3 - 2(-2)^2 - 5(-2) + 6 = 3(-8) - 2(4) - 5(-2) + 6 = -24 - 8 + 10 + 6 = -16\\\\)
Not a root.

Testing \\\\(x = 3\\\\):
\\\\(3(3)^3 - 2(3)^2 - 5(3) + 6 = 3(27) - 2(9) - 5(3) + 6 = 81 - 18 - 15 + 6 = 54\\\\)
Not a root.

Testing \\\\(x = -3\\\\):
\\\\(3(-3)^3 - 2(-3)^2 - 5(-3) + 6 = 3(-27) - 2(9) - 5(-3) + 6 = -81 - 18 + 15 + 6 = -78\\\\)
Not a root.

Testing \\\\(x = \\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\):
\\\\(3(\\\\frac{2}{3})^3 - 2(\\\\frac{2}{3})^2 - 5(\\\\frac{2}{3}) + 6\\\\)
\\\\(= 3 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{8}{27} - 2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{4}{9} - 5 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{2}{3} + 6\\\\)
\\\\(= \\\\frac{8}{9} - \\\\frac{8}{9} - \\\\frac{10}{3} + 6\\\\)
\\\\(= 0 - \\\\frac{10}{3} + 6\\\\)
\\\\(= 6 - \\\\frac{10}{3}\\\\)
\\\\(= \\\\frac{18}{3} - \\\\frac{10}{3}\\\\)
\\\\(= \\\\frac{8}{3}\\\\)
Not a root.

Testing \\\\(x = \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\):
\\\\(3(\\\\frac{1}{3})^3 - 2(\\\\frac{1}{3})^2 - 5(\\\\frac{1}{3}) + 6\\\\)
\\\\(= 3 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{27} - 2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{9} - 5 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{3} + 6\\\\)

\\\\(= -\\\\frac{1}{9} + \\\\frac{39}{9}\\\\)
\\\\(= \\\\frac{38}{9}\\\\)
Not a root.

Let me try synthetic division with \\\\(x = 2\\\\):
\\\\[
\\begin{array}{rrrr}
2 & 3 & -2 & -5 & 6 \\\\
& 6 & 8 & 6 \\\\
\\hline
& 3 & 4 & 3 & 12 \\\\
\\end{array}
\\\\]

So \\\\(x = 2\\\\) is not a factor.

Let's try with \\\\(x = -1\\\\):
\\\\[
\\begin{array}{rrrr}
-1 & 3 & -2 & -5 & 6 \\\\
& -3 & 5 & 0 \\\\
\\hline
& 3 & -5 & 0 & 6 \\\\
\\end{array}
\\\\]

This gives us \\\\(3x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = 3(x+1)(x^2-5/3)\\\\)
This was an error in my synthetic division. Let me recalculate correctly:

Synthetic division with \\\\(x = -1\\\\):
\\\\[
\\begin{array}{rrrr}
-1 & 3 & -2 & -5 & 6 \\\\
& -3 & 5 & 0 \\\\
\\hline
& 3 & -5 & 0 & 6 \\\\
\\end{array}
\\\\]

This gives us \\\\(3x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x+1)(3x^2-5x+0)\\\\)
Since 0 is a coefficient, I can simplify to \\\\((x+1)(3x^2-5x)\\\\)
Further factoring: \\\\((x+1)(3x-5)x\\\\)

So the factors are \\\\(x+1\\\\), \\\\(3x-5\\\\), and \\\\(x\\\\).
Setting each factor equal to zero:
\\\\(x+1=0\\\\) gives \\\\(x=-1\\\\)
\\\\(3x-5=0\\\\) gives \\\\(x=\\\\frac{5}{3}\\\\)
\\\\(x=0\\\\)

Therefore, the solutions to the cubic equation \\\\(3x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\\\) are:
\\\\boxed{x = -1, x = 0, x = \\\\frac{5}{3}}\\\\)`

  exampleQuestion: `Find the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (4, 9).`,
  
  exampleSolution: `To find the equation of a line passing through two points, I'll follow these steps:
1. Calculate the slope using the slope formula
2. Use the point-slope form to find the equation
3. Convert to the standard form y = mx + c

Step 1: Calculate the slope using the slope formula:
\\\\(m = \\\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\\\)
\\\\(m = \\\\frac{9 - 5}{4 - 2}\\\\)
\\\\(m = \\\\frac{4}{2}\\\\)
\\\\(m = 2\\\\)

Step 2: Use the point-slope form with the first point (2, 5):
\\\\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\\\)
\\\\(y - 5 = 2(x - 2)\\\\)
\\\\(y - 5 = 2x - 4\\\\)

Step 3: Rearrange to get the equation in the form y = mx + c:
\\\\(y - 5 = 2x - 4\\\\)
\\\\(y = 2x - 4 + 5\\\\)
\\\\(y = 2x + 1\\\\)

To verify this is correct, let's check if the second point (4, 9) satisfies our equation:
\\\\(y = 2x + 1\\\\)
\\\\(9 = 2(4) + 1\\\\)
\\\\(9 = 8 + 1\\\\)
\\\\(9 = 9\\\\) โ

Therefore, the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (4, 9) is:
\\\\boxed{y = 2x + 1}\\\\)

We can also write this in the standard form Ax + By + C = 0:
\\\\(y = 2x + 1\\\\)
\\\\(2x - y + 1 = 0\\\\)
\\\\boxed{2x - y + 1 = 0}\\\\)`
